# 🧠 Computational Intuition

**Using code to build a "gut feeling" for abstract math and physics concepts.**

## 📂 About This Repository
This project is a collection of interactive Jupyter Notebooks designed to explore, visualize, and simulate mathematical puzzles and physical phenomena. The goal isn't just to solve equations, but to *see* how they behave by building them from the ground up in Python.

## 🧪 Experiments

# 🚪 Monty Hall Problem

This experiment explores the Monty Hall problem using computational experiments to build intuition about conditional probability.

Rather than relying on analytic arguments alone, we simulate the game many times and compare the outcomes of different strategies.

**Key question:** Does switching doors actually increase your chances of winning?

**Core idea:** The host’s action is *not independent* of where the prize is.

## 🚀 Usage
Run the simulation in Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook monty_hall.ipynb
